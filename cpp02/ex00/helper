⚠️ Problems with Floats

Rounding errors → some decimals (0.1, 0.2) can’t be stored exactly in binary.

Equality checks → if (a == b) is unreliable after calculations.

Accumulated error → repeated operations (e.g., loops) make tiny mistakes bigger.

Different precisions → float (~7 digits) vs double (~15 digits).

Special values:

inf (infinity) → dividing by zero (positive or negative).

nan (not a number) → undefined math (0/0, sqrt(-1) without complex).

Platform/compiler differences → small variations in results on different machines.
